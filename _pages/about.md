About me
----------------------------------------
I am an economist specializing in industrial organization. My research focuses on the intersection of industrial organization with urban economics, commercial real estate, and finance. Since summer 2023, I have been working as an antitrust economist in the Bureau of Economics at the Federal Trade Commission. 

I earned my PhD in Economics from New York University's Stern School of Business in spring 2023. My dissertation focused on explaining the rise and persistence of storefront retail vacancies in high-end commercial corridors in New York City. I am grateful to have my research supported by NYU Stern's Center for Global Economics and Business, and the NYU Stern Center for Sustainable Business.
